  - Wow! This should do the trick! While I'm here... I have another request.
  - Sure! What else can I help you with?
  - It's my son, you see. I think he has someone in the Warren his fancies, but he
    can't seem to catch their eye. Do you have anything that can encourage a little
    romance?
  - I can concoct something with all the trimmings of a great first date; Something
    nice to drink and sweet to eat, some nice words and flowers... And of course
    something to give that tickle in your stomach. But if they don't feel the same
    about him it may not work...
  - Maybe it'll help his confidence, if nothing else. I'll take it!
  - I'll see what I can whip up!
