  StoryScript:
  - Here is your love potion, Mrs. Bunnerly. Anything else I can make for you today?
  - Now that I'm thinking of it... My friend has a birthday coming up and she's been
    saying for ages she wants some change in her life. Is that something you could
    help me with?
  - Hmmmn... How about a potion to let her be someone else for a night? A transformation
    potion!
  - That sounds lovely.
  - We'll just add a couple symbols of changing, something to reflect them and then
    the secret ingredient! A little mystery of the night.
  - Ooooh, do you giftwrap?
  - I'll see what I can do for you!
