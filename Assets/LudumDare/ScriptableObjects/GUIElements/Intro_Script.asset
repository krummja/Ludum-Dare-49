  - Hmm hm hmmmm... Oh! Hello there!
  - I'm Mochi! Welcome to my potion shop! Feel free to look around.
  - You want to know about potion-making?
  - Well, in that case - let me warn you that potions are... well, they can be very
    dangerous!
  - But if you do things right, they can be very, very lucrative.
  - In fact, if you have a minute... I have a story that might help you understand.
    It began a few months ago...
